Version 1.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Force building a 32-bit binary for Windows, by adding the -m32 flag
  to gcc in src/Makefile.win, because CRAN builds a 64-bit binary by
  default, which doesn't work on all systems.

* Added a fallback check for the exec/i386/ directory on Mac, because
  CRAN puts it there by default.

* Changed the format of the author list in DESCRIPTION.
